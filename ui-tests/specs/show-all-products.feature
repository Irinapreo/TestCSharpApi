Feature: As user I want that all products are displayed when you select "All" in the category selector.

  Scenario: Check all products are displayed.
    Given that I am on the product page
    When I choose the category "Alla"
    Then I should see the product "<product>"

    Examples:
      | category    | productName | 
      | Alla        | Saturnus    |
      | Planeter    | Saturnus    | 
      | Stj√§rnor    | Solen       |
      | Galaxer     | Vintergatan |
