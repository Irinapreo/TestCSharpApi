Feature: As user I want that all products are displayed when you select "All" in the category selector.

  Scenario: Check all products are displayed.
    Given that I am on the product page
    When I choose the category "Alla"
    Then I should see the product "<product>"

    Examples:
    | category    | productName | description
    | Alla        | Saturnus    | 25
    | Planeter    | Saturnus    | 25
    | Stj√§rnor    | Solen       | 600
    | Galaxer     | Vintergatan | 700
