Feature: As a user I want all products should be presented with their correct prices regardless of it they are shown filtered on a specific category or not

  Scenario Outline: When I choose the category <category> the product <poductName> should be shown with the price <"price">
    
    Given that I am on the product page
    When I choose the category "<category>"
    Then the product "<productName>" should be shown with the price "<price>"
